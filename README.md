Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data
========================

My solutions to the assignments of course: Data Science at Scale specialization offered by Coursera and the University of Washington.

Sentiment Analysis was one of technical skills that I would like to pick up because comments on social medias can reflect what emotions are behind people of the society. Social medias, such as Twitter or Facebook, are the casual platforms that people share their thought, life, or anything true in their mind. Because of the reason, there are many information hidden in the bunch of texts. If we can uncover the commonality of what people said with the help of sentiment analysis, we could see what the trend would be in any topic. This could benefit many fields no matter in finance or product development. That is the reason that I attended the online course to learn skills for sentiment analysis.
